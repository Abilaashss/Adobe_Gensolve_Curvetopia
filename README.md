# CURVETOPIA: A Journey into the World of Curves

Our mission is to identify, regularize, and beautify curves in 2D Euclidean space.

To test the GAN, 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Abilaashss/Adobe_Gensolve_Curvetopia
```
If you are not having a zip file containing the test images, comment down the load_and_preprocess_data function call from the main.

## Now run the Adobe_Regularise_GAN.py using

```python
python3 run main.py

```
